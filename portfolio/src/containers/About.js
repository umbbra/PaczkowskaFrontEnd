          I graduated from the Ilawa IT School, passed the E.12, E.13, E.14
          exams and went abroad to build a financial pillow. All this to become
          a Front-End Develope without studying! For this purpose, I learned
          from courses such as: Bart≈Çomiej Borowczyk: "From zero to first job"
          and UX & UI - the art of useful design.
